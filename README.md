# Digi E-Learning

## Introduction
> The ** Digi E-learning ** app is basically the online learning platform where student can get their notes related to the current syllabus they are studying right now. It is the warehouse of study notes where softcopy of notes and handwritten notes are available. Digi E-Learning app is the online equivalent of notebooks, and because they're digital, they can do more for you than paper ever could. Most can store your notes in the cloud and sync them across multiple devices. Note-taking apps also include text search, so in a matter of seconds, you can find whatever notes you need. This project includes notes from class1 to Post graduates. This notes apps let you do more than a notes from the web it has inbuilt mathematical tool which includes calculator, scientific calculator, timer, log-table, Tri-Formulae. This app has Quiz section in which students can take the quiz and evaluate their performance by their own. This app not only help students to find their flaws but also make them to increase their potential to cope up with the competitive world.

## Aim of the Project

- To provide the notes online
* Make One Stop for all Types of notes
+ To make learn things with Student’s own Pace
- To deliver the study material across any corner of the world
* Notes with Quality, easy to learn and understandable.

## Objectives of the System

> The main objective of the proect is provide the high quality notes of each class from 1 to 12 along with the graduate and post graduate .
> 
- To Provide free notes to the student
* To provide quality notes to the student
+ To avoid dependency on school or college
- Make student self dependent
* To reduce the consumption of paper
+ To upgrade student with latest information

  ## Proposed Environment System

 > The App is operational in all android devices.
> 
- Using inbuilt airthematic tools is very easy to use.
* The content is downloadable.
+ The content is readable in offline mode.
- The students can take quiz anytime.

## Feasibility Study

> A feasibility study is a preliminary study undertaken to determine and document a project’s viability. The term feasibility study is also used to refer to the resulting document. These results of this study are used to make a decision whether to proceed with the project, or table it. if it indeed leads to a project being approved, it will-before the real work of the proposed project starts-be used to ascertain the likelihood of the project’s success. it is an analysis of possible alternative solutions to a problem and a Recommendation on the best alternative. It, for example, can decide whether an 
order processing be carried out by a new system more efficiently than previous one.

> The test of feasibility stated below are equally important:-
- ** Operation feasibility: ** Do the current work practices and procedures support a new system. Also social factors i.e. how the organizational changes will affect the working lives of those affected by the application.
* ** Technical feasibility: ** The technical issue raised during the feasibility stage of investigation includes existence of necessary technology to support the proposed system, the prospects of ability to expand the system if developed etc.
+ ** Economic feasibility: ** A system that can be developed technically and that will be used if installed must still were a good investment for the organization.

## Salient Features Of The project

- ** User friendly: ** The GUI and event driven programming the system is easiest to use rather than any text mode application.
* ** Efficient and flexible: ** Object oriented approach (JAVA) made the system more Efficient and Flexible.
+ ** Data transparency: ** The process page are different than display page due to restriction of the process to the server only the actual coding and data structure are hidden from the end user.
- ** Availability: ** Only need to have an android device and a connection to the LAN or ISP. 

## Limitations of the project 
> During the development of the particular project maximum effort has been made to make the application flexible as much as possible in spite of all these, there are some limitations, which are mentioned as follows.

- At present not thinking about a ‘network ready’ one that can be used through LAN or ISP.
* This program is worth for standalone machine can not be used on network.
+ This Application is not platform independent i.e., can not be run on OS like IOS and BLACKBERRY hence lacks flexibility of cross platform operation.
- The user must aware of the correct password and user id.
* The extra tools provided like Timer are not run in background of App. 

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENT OF THE Project

>The current application can be enhanced further as we can do the following:-
>
- Make the application available for IOS, Blackberry and Window.
* Provide the video lecture of professional instructor.
+ We will store the previous result of quiz of the user.
- Too make tool run in background of app.
