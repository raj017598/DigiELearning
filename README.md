> A feasibility study is a preliminary study undertaken to determine and document a project’s viability. The term feasibility study is also used to refer to the resulting document. These results of this study are used to make a decision whether to proceed with the project, or table it. if it indeed leads to a project being approved, it will-before the real work of the proposed project starts-be used to ascertain the likelihood of the project’s success. it is an analysis of possible alternative solutions to a problem and a Recommendation on the best alternative. It, for example, can decide whether an 
order processing be carried out by a new system more efficiently than previous one.

> The test of feasibility stated below are equally important:-
- Operation feasibility: - Do the current work practices and procedures support a new system. Also social factors i.e. how the organizational changes will affect the working lives of those affected by the application.
* Technical feasibility: - The technical issue raised during the feasibility stage of investigation includes existence of necessary technology to support the proposed system, the prospects of ability to expand the system if developed etc.
+ Economic feasibility: - A system that can be developed technically and that will be used if installed must still were a good investment for the organization.
